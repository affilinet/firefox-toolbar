<p>The affilinet Publisher Firefox Toolbar provides handy functionality to pull statistics, create new advertiser partnerships and other functionality normally only available within the publisher login portal.</p>

<div role="alert" class="alert alert-info">By the end of 2017, and with the release of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar" target="_blank">Firefox 57</a> (scheduled 14th November 2017), Mozilla will move to WebExtensions exclusively, and will stop loading any other extension types on desktop such as Toolbars. affilinet has already prepared for this step, handing in a WebExtension as replacement for its current toolbar. 
With the WebExtension we not only support Firefox but also Chrome. Have a look at our new documentation: <a href="http://developer.affili.net/browser-webextension-publisher/">Browser Extension for Publishers</a>.</div>
